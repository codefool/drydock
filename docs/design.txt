<factory> - generates a specific object type periodically or on-demand

A template is derived from one of the pre-defined types detailed in drydock.xsd that can be instantiated 
within Kirok, and as such are immutable. The xsd exists solely to validate derived types defined in xml 
meet the expectations of the Kirok parser. Additional templates for defined types are in shipdef.xml, and 
are also immutable.

1.0 Ships
1.1 Ships are top-level containers consisting of six shields, one or more hulls, and zero or more systems.
1.2 Shields
1.3 Hulls
1.4 Systems

Templates

The ship definition must specify specific instances of components by id for the system. e.g., a FED phaser
will always consist of the same components, but for a specific ship class it will be for certain component
id's specific to that ship class. Rather than require the user to specify the system repeatedly, it would
be useful to specify a system "template" that would receive the id's of specific components that make up
the system. e.g.,

	<phaser-I id=<id> fireControl="11234" phaser1="3423" conduit="3323" power="3223"
	
	
<xs:complexType name="phaser-I">
	<xs:annotation>
		<xs:documentation>
			Basic template for a phaser type I system. Requires the following:
			id - identifies this system from all others in the ship class
			fireControl - the id of the fire control system
			phaser1 - the id of the actual phaser-I emmitter.
			conduit - the id of the power conduit for the phaser.
			power - the power supply of the phaser
			auxpower - auxilary power supply (optional)
			tirtpower - tirtiary power supply (optional)
